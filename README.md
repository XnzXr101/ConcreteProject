# ConcreteProject
This project predicts concrete compressive strength using features like Cement, Water, and Age. The data is preprocessed with scaling and outlier removal, followed by splitting into training and test sets. A deep learning model is built using Keras, trained over 1000 epochs, and evaluated with R-squared to ensure accurate predictions.
